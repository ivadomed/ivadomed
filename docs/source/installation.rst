Installation
============

Supported OS
------------

Currently, we only support ``MacOS`` and ``Linux`` operating systems. ``Windows``
users have the possibility to install and use ``ivadomed`` via
`Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/>`_.The steps below are strongly recommended for MacOS users in the installation process and are optional for Linux users.

Open your bash/zsh script file with editor on your computer.

    If you are using bash shell
    ::

        vim ~/.bashrc

    If you are using zsh shell
    ::
        vim ~/.zshrc

Write in your .bashrc/.zshrc file with following line.

::

    export HDF5_USE_FILE_LOCKING='FALSE'

Save this change and restart your terminal to apply the change.

There are fundamentally two different approaches to install ``IvadoMed``:

1) Install via Conda
    This is the easiest way for personal computers.

2) Install via Venv/VirtualEnv
    This is compatible with ComputeCanada cluster environment.

Approach 1: Conda
------------------

Step 1: Create new Conda Env called IvadoMedEnv (may taken 5 to 15 minutes)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

::

    conda env create --file environment.yml


Step 2 : Activate environment and use
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

::

    conda activate IvadoMedEnv

Note that this is NOT compatible with ComputeCanada because of their no anaconda policy: https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Anaconda/en


Approach 2: Venv
-----------------

Step 1: Setup Python Virtual Environment.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

``ivadomed`` requires Python >= 3.6 and <3.9. We recommend
working under a virtual environment, which could be set as follows:

::

    virtualenv venv-ivadomed
    source venv-ivadomed/bin/activate


.. warning::
   If the default Python version installed in your system does not fit the version requirements, you might need to specify a version of Python associated with your virtual environment:

   ::

     virtualenv venv-ivadomed --python=python3.6


Step 2: Install PyTorch 1.5 and TorchVision (CPU)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
::

    pip install -r requirements.txt


(Optional) Alternative Step 2: Install PyTorch 1.5 and TorchVision (GPU)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
If you have a GPU and it has CUDA already setup etc, do the follow or use whatever CUDA version you have.

::

    pip install -r requirements_gpu.txt


Step 3: Install from release (recommended)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Install ``ivadomed`` and its requirements from
`Pypi <https://pypi.org/project/ivadomed/>`__:

::

    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install ivadomed

(Optional) Alternative Step 3 for Developers: Install from source
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Bleeding-edge developments are available on the project's master branch
on Github. Installation procedure is the following:

::

    git clone https://github.com/neuropoly/ivadomed.git
    cd ivadomed
    pip install -e .


(Optional) Step 4 for Developers Install pre-commit hooks
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We use ``pre-commit`` to enforce a limit on file size.
After you've installed ``ivadomed``, install the hooks:

::

    pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
    pre-commit install
