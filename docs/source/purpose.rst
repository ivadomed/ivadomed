Purpose
=======

The purpose of the ``ivadomed`` project is to:

* Provide researchers with an open-source framework for training deep learning models for applications in medical imaging;

* Provide ready-to-use :doc:`pretrained_models` trained on multi-center data.

(1): "BIDS" stands for the `Brain Imaging Data Structure <https://bids.neuroimaging.io/>`_, which is a convention initiated by the neuroimaging community to organize datasets (filenames, metadata, etc.). This facilitates the sharing of datasets and minimizes the burden of organizing datasets for training.
